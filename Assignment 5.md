 - [ ]  Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
 Using contradiction, assume radical 2 is rational and can be expressed as b/a, where b and a have no common factors.
 - [ ] 2^(1/2) = b/a
 - [ ] 2 = b^2/a^2
 - [ ] b^2 = 2a^2
 
 b^2 is even so b must be even and divisible by 4. So q^2 and q must be even also. This is a contradiction that b and a must have no common factors so the square root of 2 cannot be rational.
 - [ ]  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
 - [ ]  The sum of two odd integers is even.  Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1	
 - [ ]  The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
 - [ ]  If n squared is odd, then n is odd
