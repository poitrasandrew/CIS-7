2.a. Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither: (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B)
    | A | B | ¬A | ¬B | ¬B → ¬A | ¬B → A | ((¬B → A) → B)
    |---|---|--- |--- | ------- | ------ | --------------
    | T | T |    |    |         |        | 
    | T | F |    |    |         |        |
    | F | T |    |    |         |        |
    | F | F |    |    |         |        |
