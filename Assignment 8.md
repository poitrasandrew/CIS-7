The Proof by Contraposition video was the most helpful to me. I understood the basic concepts of contraposition from the lecture, but the application of it past the basics confused me a little bit. The video helped me with the proofs assignment and assured me that the opposite of an odd number is an even number(not the point of the video but it was mentioned in it), I had trouble agreeing with that on my own because my thought process is that a number can also be zero which doesn't seem to be either even or odd and still is an integer. My thoughts about zero are still there but at least the video helped me complete the assignment from that week.
